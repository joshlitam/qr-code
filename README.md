## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learned that by using bootstrap for the first time, there are default bootstrap elements that need to be overwritten to achieve the inteded result.
For example, the card-body of bootstrap cards already contain certain default elements like margin that I adjusted.


```css
.card-body {
    padding-top: 0px;
    margin: 0 13px 20px;
}
```
